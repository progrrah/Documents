## определение языка
язык - структ система коммуникации, которая состоит из следующих подсистем.
фонемная
морфологическая
лексическая
синтаксическая
эти подсистемы называются уровнями языка, потому что в границах этих уровней есть однородные по своим свойствам элементы, которые выделяются и рассмотрением которых можно заняться

значящим словом для нас в определении будет являться слово система
потому что в системы есть набор структурных правил благодаря которым язык является осмысленным являнием и благодаря которому мы можем использовать его, передавать мысли, вести разговор

набор этих правил позволяет образовывать слова предложения целые высказывания


This is the most important aspect of language. Every language is based on a set of structural elements, phonology, morphology, syntax, and
semantics. These structures combine with each other according to systematic rules. These rules can be established by observing and describing how native speakers of a language speak. Each language has a specific set of sounds that are combined in specific, systematic methods to create words, which are then combined in specific, systematic methods to form meaningful utterances. If these methods were not systematic, then all utterances would be random and therefore meaningless. No one would be able to learn the rules, and thus no one would be able to understand what anyone else was saying.

This description of language as a system applies to all languages and all varieties of languages, whether the language of the most literate and wealthy members of societies, or the language of illiterate hunter-gatherers, or of any poor or lower-class speakers dwelling in impoverished areas throughout the world. We know this because all languages are equally capable of being understood by their speakers. Some people think that certain languages, or certain varieties of a single language, are somehow better at communication than others, more elegant, precise, or romantic, or that some language varieties are sloppier, simpler, less emotional, or more violent, etc. than other languages. None of this is true. All languages are equally systematic and thus all are equally able to express the concepts needed by its community of speakers.


One aspect of morphology is the study of the lexicon of a language. The lexicon is not only all the words of a language, but also all the prefixes or suffixes used in a language, that is, the lexicon of a language is all the morphemes of that language. Thus, luck is a member of the English lexicon, but so is the prefix un- and the suffix -y that you can use to create the word unlucky. Similarly, walk is a member of the English lexicon, but so are the suffixes -ed, -ing, and –s that you can use to create the words walked, walking, and walks. In the same way that phonology has phonemes and morphology has morphemes, the lexicon of a language has lexemes. A lexeme is a basic unit of lexical meaning, regardless of how many morphemes are used to create that meaning: Thus, walk, walks, walked, walking, and walker are all forms of the same lexeme WALK.

Semantics is the study of the meanings of these lexemes. Semantics deals with how words can mean, where they derive their meanings from (e.g., from mental images, from usage, etc), and how these meanings can shift or change over time. At the heart of this is the study of the sign, and how the signifier points to and is related to the signified.
